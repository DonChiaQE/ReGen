Exploration of recursion and early 20th C. abstract art (Suprematism and Generative) through interactive canvas. 

Built with SwiftUI and acts as a proof of concept that you can actually recursively draw SwiftUI views with recursion (something I did not realise was possible).

Users can create shapes and manipulate their translation to create unique looks while also exploring the concept of Suprematism (Supremus), an art movement that focused on making use of basic shapes to create art works.
